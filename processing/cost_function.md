Areal = $7.20 per foot
Buried(Rural) = $5.36 per foot
Buried(Suburban) = $8.90 per foot
Buried(Urban) = $10.84 per foot
Underground(Rural) = $24.31 per foot
Underground (Suburban) = $28.37 per foot
Underground (Urban) = $33.37 per foot

(S) – State 
(dl) = Density Location - Rural | Suburban | Urban

D = Distance from school to optimum fiber connection point in meters

PM = Percent Plant Mix – Percent of distance that should be Aerial (a), Buried (b) or Underground (u) based on the school’s location in a State (S) and its Location (l).  Three different PM scenarios will be generated; Option1 where all lines are distribution lines; Option 2 where all lines are feeder lines and; Option 3 where a simple average of feeder and distribution lines are applied.  Percent Plant-Mix

3.28084 is Meters to Feet conversion

CA – Cost Adjustment rate is a multiplier based on the first three digits of a ZIP code and applied an increase or decrease to the total cost based on local construction operating costs.
